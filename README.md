# Advent of Code 2017

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from the [Advent of
Code][aoc] event. They are all written in OCaml (compiler version 4.05.0) with
Jane Street's [Core][core] standard library overlay.

## Usage

```sh
# Run all of the solutions
user@host:~/advent-of-code-2017/ > jbuilder runtest

# Run a specific day's solutions

user@host:~/advent-of-code-2017/01/ > jbuilder runtest
